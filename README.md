# Data-Analysis-Project-01

This is a very quick data analysis project for the palm oil mill in the belonging to the organisation where I currently work. This analysis was conducted to gain insights into the data provided by the procurement department of the organisation.

The project was carried out using the jupyter notebook that comes with the python Anaconda distribution. The IDE used for this project is Virtual Studio Code (VS Code).

The data is a times series dataset.
